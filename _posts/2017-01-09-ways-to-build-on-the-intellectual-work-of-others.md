I often hear intellectuals say that they want others to build on their ideas. Unfortunately, since intellectual work is abstract, there is rarely a clear set of next steps to be taken. This causes many capable people, who are motivated to contribute, to mostly sit around waiting for original ideas. Meanwhile, plenty of old, promising ideas end up amounting to nothing.

So I'm compiling a list of ways to contribute to the intellectual work of others. If you'd like to contribute to this project, well, see below. Hopefully you'll be well-furnished with ideas.
