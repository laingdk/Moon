I often hear intellectuals say that they want others to build on their ideas. Unfortunately, there is rarely a clear set of next steps to be taken for a given project. This causes many capable people, who are motivated to contribute, to mostly sit around waiting for their own original ideas.

Truly original ideas are hard to generate, and not everyone is well-suited to the task. But originality is not a necessary component of a valuable contribution to an intellectual project. In fact, once you let go of the need to be original, your options for contribution multiply.

I'm compiling a list of ways to contribute to the intellectual work of others. If you'd like to contribute to this project, well, see below for suggestions.

## Improving or expanding presentability

### Summarize.
Present the original material in a shorter form.

- Ethical Systems writes [summaries](http://ethicalsystems.org/content/books) of books related to business ethics.
- Tim Urban of Wait But Why wrote and illustrated two [blog](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) [posts](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html) about AI safety, drawing mainly from Nick Bostrom's book [*Superintelligence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies).

### Share your confusion.
When something is unclear to you, say so. This could help the original author, and other people who may get involved in the project, to anticipate points of confusion for future audiences.

- People often do this in the comments sections on [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/).

### Present the material to a different audience or for a different purpose.

- Obama Administration AI report

### Translate to a different medium.
Different audiences respond better to different media. Also, certain media are better for certain cognitive tasks.

- Kurzgezagt made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348) to present work on population growth that was originally done by Max Roser of [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).
- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!) is the book version of a series of taped interviews with Richard Feynman.

### Transfer to a different level of formality.
- 

#### Share and promote the original work.
This is extremely easy, and especially valuable if you have a large following. It's also good on a small scale; by sharing something with one or two close friends, you might create positive ripple effects.

- Steven Pinker uses his [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sapinker) mainly to promote web content that he believes others should see.
