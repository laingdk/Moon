I often hear intellectuals say that they want others to build on their ideas. But I'm rarely clear on how to do this. There would be no point in simply declaring agreement, since I don't have especially high status.

I doubt I'm the only one who feels this way. There are lots of smart, hard-working people who would be glad to contribute to the intellectual work of others, but mostly sit around waiting for original ideas. This need not be so. 

I'm compiling a list of ways to contribute to the work of others. If you'd like to contribute to my project, see below.
