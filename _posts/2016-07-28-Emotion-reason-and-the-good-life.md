<h1 id="1">Introduction</h1>
In <a href="http://verybadwizards.com/episodes/94" target="_blank">Episode 94 of the podcast Very Bad Wizards</a>, the philosopher Tamler Sommers and the psychologist Dave Pizarro discuss whether emotions should play any role in forming our beliefs and guiding our actions. They consider two relevant philosophies that are present in today’s culture: utilitarianism and Stoicism.

Utilitarianism, best summed up by the phrase “the greatest good for the greatest number,” is represented in a growing social movement called effective altruism, which encourages people to do as much good as possible with their time and money. For example, a utilitarian might donate to the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/" target="_blank">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which saves lives very efficiently by dispensing cheap bed-nets that protect African children from the mosquitoes that carry malaria. Does that engage your emotions? For utilitarians, it doesn’t matter: emotion is mud on the windshield. It focuses our moral gaze on ourselves and our in-groups, and it distracts us from our highest duty to protect and nurture all conscious beings in the universe.

Stoicism, best summed up by the phrase “what will be will be,” is represented in our culture’s enthusiasm for mindfulness meditation. For the Stoic, emotion is nothing but a source of pain. It ties us to parts of the world that are outside our control, and it guarantees suffering.

Dave and Tamler give thorough and fair-minded evaluations of each philosophy, but their conversation leaves something to be desired. Midway through the episode, Dave makes a great point that much discourse in psychology — and philosophy too, Tamler agrees — is unproductive because people mistakenly think of most concepts as dichotomies. These are the examples they give: the metaphor of the mind as comprising System 1 and System 2; the predominant competing moral philosophies of utilitarianism and deontology; and, most relevant to this episode, the ever-discussed clash between reason and emotion.

By my reckoning, they then fall into the exact trap they just complained about. They focus only on extreme and rare situations that seem to bring reason and emotion into conflict, and then they end the conversation too soon to resolve the apparent contradictions. They fail to find actionable conclusions about how to live. That should be the goal of any conversation about ethics, so in this essay I’ll try to get us there.
<h1 id="2">Is morality contradictory?</h1>
They begin by examining a common objection to utilitarianism, which Dave illustrates with an anecdote. His daughter’s beloved dog was badly injured, and one of their friends set up a GoFundMe page to solicit donations for the treatment. Dave couldn’t bring himself to ask his Facebook friends for donations, partly since he knew that a few of his friends had just lost family members to cancer, and partly because he has some sympathy with the effective altruist credo that if you’re spending a dollar to do some good, you ought to spend it in the way that will do the most good. If someone were to donate to help the dog, then the dog would feel better, but the foregone donation to the Against Malaria Foundation would result in an otherwise preventable death of an African family.

At the same time, the outpouring of love and generosity from Dave’s family and friends was a truly enriching experience — the type of emotional experience that makes life worth living. That’s the most compelling objection to utilitarianism: if your moral circle includes every conscious being in the universe, you will forego some essential part of the good life. As much as Dave can see the harsh logic of utilitarianism, he recognizes that there is something deeply precious about in-group generosity.

In this way, he sympathizes with an extremely anti-utilitarian idea that Aristotle had 2500 years ago: that the concept of ethics only applies to people we have lasting relationships with. (To be clear, Aristotle was historically far closer to the beginnings of moral philosophy than was utilitarianism, which didn’t show up until Jeremy Bentham founded it in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.) Aristotle believed that if we’re considering whether we have an ethical duty to serve the wellbeing of people we will never meet, then we’re thinking about something so emotionally foreign that it is separate from ethics.

As far as I can tell, Tamler isn’t explicitly Aristotelian on this point, but he is confident in viewing emotion as a core element of the good life. When pressed by Dave on how emotion might guide his actions, he explains that, for instance, the approval or disapproval of his friends — even if they don’t provide reasons — is a practicable source of moral guidance. If somebody he knows and trusts tells him, “You’re being a dick, Tamler,” he might not need anything more articulate to change his behaviour. The negative emotions brought on by that disapproval would be enough to justify changing his behaviour, and thus morality doesn’t require reason.

But now we reach something of a contradiction. Reason seems to impose too many constraints on our behaviour to be practical, but emotion imposes too few to be meaningful; as Dave points out, couldn’t Tamler’s yay-boo system justify any behaviour at all? This point generalizes to all emotions, even ones not evoked by friends: if we’re basing our morality on our emotions, doesn’t all of morality depend on how each of us happens to feel?

Upon reaching this apparent contradiction, someone might say, “Actually, yeah. And that’s the whole point of moral philosophy: to get better at justifying whatever it was we wanted to do in the first place.” Why bother with ethics when you can manage hedge funds?

Conversations like these should leave room for jokes, but not shrugs. People are dying.

The nihilist’s mistake is to assume that if you run into a contradiction, there must be something wrong with the very principle of non-contradiction — that a proposition cannot be simultaneously true and false — which is the basic premise upon which almost all of science and philosophy rests.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref">[1]</a> In that moment, the nihilist forgets the tremendous power of this basic principle, which was the first step in the line of reasoning that unlocked the secrets of our genes, gave us medicine that actually works, and sent us to the moon. The nihilist decides that it’s more likely that the entire project of reason is pointless than it is that he himself might have made a mistake in the past few minutes.

As it happens, there is no contradiction in using reason to guide our actions and form our beliefs. Instead, there is a simple mistake in the assumption that the goals of utilitarianism are best achieved if everyone prioritizes utilitarian goals with every local act. The reason we get confused about this is that our emotions often do point to what our reason says is moral, so we assume that our emotions have something fundamentally true to say about morality. They don’t.

Here is the most coherent statement of where morality comes from: moral value exists wherever there is subjective experience and a set of preferences, and moral behaviour is that which protects and nurtures moral value. You don’t need your emotions to guide you to the parts of the universe that are morally valuable; you just need a reasonable belief about what causes subjective experience: possession of a brain.
<h1 id="3">Evolution, game theory, and the limits of moral intuition</h1>
Fortunately, our emotions largely do point toward beings with moral value. This is because things with brains were highly consequential in our ancestral environment, and our ancestors’ paying attention to them led to greater reproductive success. From an evolutionary perspective, it pays to feel emotion, quickly and strongly, when we see potential predators, prey, mates, or offspring. Naturally, these emotion magnets are the parts of our universe that have the capacity to value, to suffer, and in precious cases to live joyfully and creatively. You don’t need to feel those feelings vicariously in order to perceive their existence. Reason does a perfectly adequate job of locating moral value.

Of course, you might not be motivated to <em>protect</em> the moral value of other conscious beings if your emotions are not calibrated to do so. But this is not a theoretical problem. It’s a practical one, and there is an empirical fact that simplifies it: consciousness (so far) has arisen <em>only</em> through natural selection, which inexorably creates beings that value <em>themselves</em>.

For example, consider a sadist. Do his emotions motivate him to protect any beings with moral value? Yes: he values himself. If there is a siren going off in your head when you consider whether sadists are morally valuable, remember that sadism is just a description of a person’s psychology, not of their behaviour. You shouldn’t condemn a sadist for happening to be wired in a way that makes him enjoy the suffering of others, just as you shouldn’t condemn a pedophile for happening to be wired to find children sexually attractive. You should condemn people for their intentional actions.

Reason shows us that nobody should vote for a universe filled with only sadists — not because sadism is Bad, but because sadists would all be motivated to destroy each other, thus depleting the universe of all subjective experience. A sadist universe is not value-neutral compared to our own; a sadist universe leads to a universe with nobody to do the valuing.

It is morally convenient that most of us are not sadists, but ultimately that’s just a descriptive fact about our psychology, not a prescriptive fact about why thinking of others is a good way to fill the universe with happiness. Moral behaviour can be rationally derived from three game-theoretical features of our reality: we know we are not alone; we know we can affect each other; and we know that we are all better off if we consider each other’s wellbeing.

So, Aristotle was almost right when he said that ethics only exists in the context of personal relationships. In fact, ethics is simply <em>relational</em>. It exists in the context of <em>recognition of other conscious beings who can affect you and whom you can affect</em>. Ethics is the question of what to do about the fact that we care about ourselves but we know we are not alone.

When "moral" means "instrumental in bringing about more happy conscious states," moral propositions are true or false, just as propositions about how to get to Toronto are true or false. That doesn't mean every organism will want to go to Toronto, but nor does it mean you need an innate mental map of Ontario to figure out how to get there. Some organisms may innately behave in ways that bring about moral ends, as we do when we care for each other. But our moral intuitions are not morality itself; they just represent the functionally relevant parts of it, the same way a map represents its territory. We should not mistake moral intuition for moral truth, because this kind of mistake — the kind that makes philosophers shrug at contradictions or decide that reason itself is pointless — is what ends up killing people.
<h1 id="4">Guilt-free utilitarianism</h1>
Imagine a hockey coach who doesn’t allow for more nuance than “score as many goals as possible.” Scoring goals is the direct measure by which we determine whether a team has succeeded, but that doesn’t mean the players should never focus on defence, passing, or positioning. Similarly, "the greatest good for the greatest number" is an appropriate end-goal for moral behaviour, but that doesn't mean everyone should maximize immediate utility with every single act.

Dave and Tamler point out that donating to save your friend’s dog does less good than donating to the Against Malaria Foundation, and that the practice of in-group generosity is so powerful and so valuable that perhaps it ought to supersede the utilitarian calculus.

Depending on the situation, it absolutely should. In-groups are better at caring for each other than out-groups are. The family unit is the best social structure for raising a child. The municipal government is the best social structure for administering a city. And the fundamentally human emotions that drive familial love and patriotism are great buttresses for these social structures; we didn’t need to invent game theory to figure out that family units are useful, because natural selection cooked it right into our genes. But the high value of in-groups is not a knockdown argument against utilitarianism. It’s just a strategically wise way to structure a society so that many people can live in it happily.

In middle-class North American society, the people in our in-groups require far less attention and care than people elsewhere, because of the boring fact that each person in our in-groups typically has more than 20 times the wealth of the average global citizen. In fact, most of the people in our in-groups would reject our gifts and favours if we were to shunt all our excess wealth onto theirs, as this would violate our social norms.

Of course, our friends and family may <em>occasionally</em> need our help. But those are not the times to get all self-reflective and doubtful of whether our emotions should ever motivate us to help people. The crucial moments to think about ethics are the boring, day-to-day moments that comprise 99% of our lives. These are the moments that stretch out during the months and years between the rites and tragedies that call for us to immediately prioritize our in-groups. The emotions we feel in these day-to-day moments are rightly determined by our own immediate states; but as long as our basic needs are met, those emotions will be mostly positive and self-centred, and thus inadequate to form the basis of our moral compass.

We should value reason in all moments, not just when our emotions are intense enough to make us doubt our reason. We should think through what it means to be ethical during those times when our emotions point nowhere in particular. We should act on our emotions in the moments when we’re participating in the in-group norms that keep society intact. And we should not worry that parochial love contradicts the broader goals of utilitarianism.
<h1 id="5">Stoicism and personal wellbeing</h1>
Dave and Tamler finish the episode with a discussion of Stoicism, the Ancient Greek school of philosophy whose proponents encourage you to seek equanimity at all times. Stoicism is similar to Buddhism in that it advocates a renouncement of all worldly attachment, which is seen as the source of all suffering. Unlike utilitarianism, Stoicism is a philosophical response to personal suffering. It helps us answer the question: what can we do about our fickle emotions that would cause us pain even if we were the only person in the universe and our actions had no externalities whatsoever?

Dave and Tamler are fairly lukewarm on Stoicism. They point out that if you resist your love for a family member just because of the certainty that you will suffer intensely upon losing them, you will forego one of the pleasures that make your own life worth living. In the long-term, your life will be one of lower satisfaction, even if your equanimity succeeds in mitigating your most painful moments. I agree that Stoicism is flawed in precisely this way.

I also think that historically, Stoicism was an ingenious solution for a world that was much harder to live in than our own, both for obvious reasons of health and access to resources, and for the epistemic limitations of life before science. The Stoics didn’t know about natural selection. They didn’t know what the sun was. They had barely conceived of logic and math, and the concepts of psychology and statistics were two millennia away. Stoic philosophers were seriously limited by their poor understanding of the workings of the universe and of the origins of humanity.

Yet the Stoics correctly reasoned as follows: that there is much in life that we cannot control; that we do have some control over our emotions; and that we should therefore strive to reconcile our emotions with the parts of life that we cannot control. The wisdom of this realization has been borne out by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400080/" target="_blank">many recent studies</a> that show mindfulness meditation’s effectiveness in helping people reach acceptance and achieve greater control over their lives in the face of various personal challenges.

The Stoic insight is that to live happily, we should exert some control over how we assign value to our own conscious states. To do this, we must monitor our emotions and take their quality into account when we deliberate over how to protect our own wellbeing. This monitoring is important for our own sake, as we ourselves are morally valuable. It helps us see the negative long-term consequences of pursuing the most pleasant conscious state in each short-term moment, thus protecting us from enjoyable but self-destructive behaviours.

Emotional monitoring is also important for the sake of others, whose wellbeing depends partly on our capacity to nurture them. If we let our dogs die for the greater good, we will fill our own lives with suffering, which will hamper our own ability to contribute to the greater good, thus negating our prior effort. Emotional monitoring helps us see the long-term negative consequences of pursuing the end-goal of utilitarianism in each short-term moment, thus protecting us from myopic self-sacrifice.
<h1 id="6">What to do next</h1>
Emotion has an important role in the good life. Without it, an individual life is deprived of its own meaning and value. Moreover, because of our game-theoretical evolutionary origins, our emotions often point us in the right moral direction. Sometimes they are perfectly serviceable — even useful — like when they inspire us to care for our families, our friends, and ourselves. However, our emotions don’t reliably tell us how our day-to-day actions and inactions affect other conscious beings, the billions of other precious slivers of moral value that glow and fade in our dark universe. And so our emotions are mostly inadequate as guides of moral behaviour.

Enjoy your positive emotions. Don’t resist them simply because you fear the ugly underbelly of attachment; in moments of loss you will have just as much access to Stoic damage control as you would have if you’d tried to pre-empt the pain. Act confidently on the emotions that motivate you to help others flourish, whether directly or through the upholding of beneficial social norms. And if your life is good, and the lives of your family and friends and dogs are good, take a look beyond your in-group. You will see that <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">there is much to be done</a>, and that all of it is too important to be obscured by however you happen to feel.

Although I’ve been critical, Very Bad Wizards is a fantastic podcast that always makes me laugh and think. I could write dozens of equally long essays about what I’ve learned from other episodes, but instead I’ll just recommend that you listen for yourself.

If you’ve thought about this before, you might be asking, “What about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox" target="_blank">Epimenides paradox</a>? What about sentences like “I am currently lying,” which cannot be either true or false?” You may notice that these particular paradoxes are different than “the sky is blue and not blue” in that they contain flavours of recursion and self-reference. They are supremely interesting, and I recommend that you read <em><a href="https://betweenbeats.wordpress.com/2016/04/30/i-just-finished-godel-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid/" target="_blank">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a></em> before throwing out the entire edifice of philosophy.
