description: A summary of my year, with lists of favourite media.

At the end of every year, I like to reflect on some of the major things that have happened in my life, and make some lists of favourite things I've enjoyed.

## What happened in my life?

From January to April I finished my coursework in the Master of Data Science program at UBC. It was such a privilege to be part of the first cohort of this program. I had incredible teachers and a tight-knit group of smart, motivated classmates. I especially enjoyed my courses in machine learning and data visualization.

In May and June I worked on a capstone project with three of my classmates: we built a prototype of a dashboard to help edX instructors understand how students are engaging with course content. It was exciting to see how much we were able to accomplish in just two months of work.

In August I started my new job as a data scientist at the [Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology (CTLT)](https://ctlt.ubc.ca/) at UBC. In this first month, I mainly read proposals for pilot projects in learning analytics. I also learned a little bit of data visualization in D3.js. It was a fairly gentle start, since the real work wouldn't begin until the start of the school year.

In September I took a brief break from full-time work at the CTLT so I could teach [DSCI 542 Communication and Argumentation](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-11-10-DSCI-542-communication/) in the Master of Data Science program. It was an absolute joy â€“ definitely the best teaching experience I've ever had. My students were engaged, my TAs were fantastic, and I was given lots of freedom to design the course however I liked. What a privilege.

From October to December I've been working full-time at the CTLT. My time is split half-and-half between two broad types of activities. One is development and analysis: I work with software and data to automate tasks and answer questions related to teaching and learning. The other is research and engagement: I work with people, usually faculty members or department heads, to understand needs and literacies around data and analytics. The work has been at times quite challenging, mainly because I have so many projects on the go at the same time. But I'm learning a lot, and I'm excited to get back to work in the new year.

## Books

I didn't read as many books this year as usual. I would say that there were only two books I really loved, which I would confidently recommend to any curious friend:

* [*Algorithms to Live By*](https://www.amazon.ca/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365), by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
	* It's rare that I read a book that touches on so many foundational concepts in an academic discipline (in this case, computer science) and also relates to so much of daily life. I finished this book in early October, and I've thought about it almost every week since.
* [*The Happiness Hypothesis*](https://www.amazon.ca/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514328713&sr=1-1&keywords=the+happiness+hypothesis), by Jonathan Haidt
	* *The Happiness Hypothesis* is to psychology as *Algorithms to Live By* is to computer science. Haidt is an incredible writer, and I've thought about ideas in this book many times since I finished it.

There were several others that I liked quite a bit, but which I would recommend more tentatively. Alphabetically by author:

* *How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big*, by Scott Adams
* *Superintelligence*, by Nick Bostrom
* *Sapiens*, by Yuval Noah Harrari
* *Homo Deus*, by Yuval Noah Harrari
* *The Nurture Assumption*, by Judith Rich Harris
* *Chaos*, by James Gleick
* *Never Let Me Go*, by Kazuo Ishiguro
* *Houston, We Have a Narrative*, by Randy Olson
* *Everybody Lies*, by Seth Stevens-Davidowitz
* *Inadequate Equilibria*, by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I don't often reread books, but this year I reread two. That fact alone should recommend them:

* [*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*](http://www.hpmor.com/), by Eliezer Yudkowsky
* [*The Sense of Style*](https://www.amazon.ca/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0670025852/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514328774&sr=1-1&keywords=the+sense+of+style), by Steven Pinker

I also read [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) from start to finish, which felt like quite an accomplishment. I think this was the first time I've ever read an entire textbook. For anyone who aspires to do this sort of thing, I highly recommend forming a reading group with two to three others. Two of my friends and I read a chapter or two each week, and met for a few hours to talk through the practice problems.
