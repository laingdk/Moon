The first lesson in economics is that in a free market, the price of a good tends to settle where the supply curve meets the demand curve:

If the price is too high, suppliers have more of the product than buyers want, so the price decreases as suppliers compete with each other to make the sale. If the price is too low, buyers want more of the product than the suppliers have, so the price increases as buyers compete with each other to win the auction.

This begs the question: why is it that in some markets, there are multiple prices for a single product? For example, why do airlines choose to separate plane seats into business class and economy, each with its own price? You'd expect the airline to charge the same price to everyone if the price were set by the market.

The answer is that buyers and sellers don't know the same information. In this case, the airline (the seller) doesn't know how highly a given passenger (the buyer) values her money. It may be that Alice would pay \$100 at most for a ticket, while Bob would pay as much as \$200. But if the airline only sells tickets at \$100 apiece, then some passengers will be paying less than they could otherwise afford. And if the airline only sells tickets at /$200 apiece, then some people won't buy a ticket at all.

One solution is to present a menu of options, thereby causing buyers to reveal their values when they makes their choice. Alice buys economy class, Bob buys business class, and the airline profits maximally from both of them.

By presenting a menu of options, the airline is trying to solve the general problem of *information asymmetry*, which was first described in 1970 in George Akerlof's landmark [paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431), "The Market for "Lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism." Akerlof showed that when buyers and sellers don't know the same information, the market shrinks.

To illustrate this phenomenon, Akerlof presents an example of a used-car lot. Some cars are "lemons" – low-quality cars worth \$500 – and some cars are "peaches" – high-quality cars worth \$1,000.

Now, imagine you're a buyer who wants a peach, but you can't tell the peaches from the lemons. How much should you offer? You wouldn't offer \$1,000 for a car if you thought there was a 50% chance it's a lemon. You'd offer the average of the two prices, \$750, to account for the risk of being ripped off.

But now you realize: the seller wouldn't sell a peach for only \$750 – it's worth more than that! In fact, as long as you're offering less than \$1,000, the seller will only ever sell you a lemon, because that's the only way to profit. So your final offer is $500, and you drive away in a lemon. In fact, if all buyers are as wily as you, *everyone* drives away in a lemon. The peaches never leave the lot; the market has been shrunk by information asymmetry.
