"Know thyself." – Mark Twain, probably

But how? A tool for the task was developed in 1955 by the psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham. They called it the Johari window – so named because "Johari" is a wicked combination of their first names, Joe and Harry.

The Johari window was originally used to categorize the ways a person perceives herself and the ways others perceive her. First, the person is asked to select descriptions of herself from a list of adjectives, e.g.:

- shy
- smart
- funny
- organized
- talkative
- aggressive
- gracious
- smelly

Maybe she thinks she's "smart," "organized," "talkative," and "gracious."

Next, her peers describe her by selecting from the same set of words. Say they think she's "smart," "funny," "organized," and "smelly." The chosen adjectives are then categorized in the Johari window:

<style>
table {
    border-collapse: separate
}
.square {
    float:center;
    position: relative;
    width: 40%;
    padding-bottom: 15%;
    align:right;
    margin:10%;
    overflow:hidden;
}
</style>


<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2", rowspan="2",  align="center", style='border-left:none;border-top:none;border-right:none;border-bottom:none'><b>Johari Window</b></td>
		<td colspan="2", align="center"><i>Self-knowledge state</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><b>Known to self</b></td>
		<td align="center"><b>Unknown to self</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2">
			<i>Knowledge<br>
			state of<br>
			others<br>
			</i>
		</td>
		<td><b>Known to others</b></td>
		<td class="square", align="left"><i>smart, organized</i></td>
		<td class="square", align="left"><i>funny, smelly</i></td>
	</tr>
		<td><b>Unknown to others</b></td>
		<td class="square", align="left"><i>talkative, gracious</i></td>
		<td class="square", align="left"><i>shy, aggressive</i></td>
	</tr>
</table>

The Johari window has been used in many organizational settings to help people undestand themselves and their relationships with others.

I've come up with a variant of the Johari window that I believe is useful in science and decision-making. I call it the Epistemic Johari window. Instead of describing intersections between a given person's knowledge and other people's knowledge, the Epistemic Johari window describes intersections between one's knowledge and one's meta-knowledge, i.e. one's knowledge about one's knowledge.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2", rowspan="2",  align="center", style='border-left:none;border-top:none;border-right:none;border-bottom:none'><b>Epistemic Johari Window</b></td>
		<td colspan="2", align="center"><i>Knowledge State</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><b>Known</b></td>
		<td align="center"><b>Unknown</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2">
			<i>Meta-<br>
			Knowledge<br>
			State<br>
			</i>
		</td>
		<td><b>Known</b></td>
		<td class="square", align="center">Examined beliefs</td>
		<td class="square", align="center">Gaps</td>
	</tr>
		<td><b>Unknown</b></td>
		<td class="square", align="center">Impressions generated by biases & heuristics</td>
		<td class="square", align="center">Unknown</td>
	</tr>
