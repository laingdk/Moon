title: Information is bad at being money
description: In the digital world, purchases are often made with personal data rather than with money. This might turn out to be kind of absurd.

What if, instead of paying money for your food, you had to implant in your upper pallate a small sensor that would send information to your insurance company about everything you eat? What if, instead of paying money for your new mattress, you had to put a camera on your wall and record your bedroom activities, all to be uploaded constantly and automatically to the mattress company's database?

Until recently, it was rare that a good or a service was exchanged for something other than money. But the digital economy runs largely on a new form of currency: information. It is traded on two levels.

On the first level, a person trades her private information in exchange for the use a software service. Companies like Google and Facebook give us access to their services in exchange for our consent that our data will be stored, used, and sometimes sold. The main benefit of first-level information-as-currency is easy to see: there is virtually full equality in people's ability to generate data. In the current system, anybody with internet access can do a Google search; if a search cost \$100, only the rich could afford it.

On the second level, an organization trades people's private information in exchange for money or some other good. Companies like [Acxiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acxiom) and [Experian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian) collect people's personal data and sell it to whoever will pay. The data can be collected from public sources, such as voter's lists, or from private sources, such as smartphone app companies that got the data through first-level exchanges. Second-level information exchanges have clear benefits too. The best example is medical data. Although it is often highly sensitive, medical data could help doctors and scientists develop better treatments. This only works if someone does the work of collecting, cleaning, and storing the data – and that is second-level work, which can only take place after many first-level exchanges have occurred.

However, the sale of personal data by one organization to another organization seems like a recipe for negative [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) – costs created by organizations but felt by individuals. To put it more concretely, it seems unlikely that two people talking about a third person's secrets would ever help the third person. Not only does second-level information-as-currency increase the risk of privacy threats, but it increases asymmetries of power between corporations and individuals. So we have to ask: is there a way to get the benefits of second-level information exchange while reducing its risks?
 
One proposal is for companies to deidentify personal data before selling it to a third party. For example, rather than selling the information that John Smith had the flu, the company would sell the information that a person with ID number 1983824309 had the flu, or simply that someone had the flu. However, as I explained in my [previous post](https://laingdk.github.io/information-theory-and-tradeoffs-in-data-disclosure/), anonymization and generalization are, at best, ways to *mitigate* privacy threats, and they come at the cost of making data less useful. The only way to guarantee full security against inference attacks is to not reveal any information in the first place.
 
Now, given that deidentified data can be made arbitrarily safe from privacy threats, is it good that such data can be bought and sold? This question is hard to answer without considering the ways in which information is unusual as an economic good. As explained by [DeLong and Froomkin (1999)](http://personal.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/spec.htm):
 
- Information is *non-excludable*, which means that it's impossible (or very hard) to prevent non-paying customers from getting it. Unlike clothing, which is stored securely in a person's closet after they purchase it, information lives either in the mind or in an easily copied digital format. If you've ever illegally downloaded a movie, you know how easy it is to get certain types of information without paying for it. 
- Information is *non-rivalrous*, which means that one person's consumption does not preclude another person's consumption. Unlike a parking space, which can be used by only one car, information can be used (known) by virtually everybody at the same time. If you watch a movie, that doesn't stop me from watching it too.
- Information is *non-transparent*, which means that its value is known only to those who already own it. Unlike a car, which you can take for a test drive to learn its value, information must itself be known for its value to be known. If you've ever paid to watch a movie that you ended up hating, you know that information about the value of the product was in the information itself.
 
Information-as-currency looks much less attractive when you consider that real money has been expressly crafted as information's economic polar opposite. Money is excludable: give someone a \$20 bill and they will guard it carefully until the moment they use it. Money is rivalrous: either I spend my \$20 or you do, but we can't spend the full amount twice. Money is transparent: tell me you have a \$20 bill, and I know exactly how much that bill is worth, even if I never own it myself.
 
Despite the social value to be found in all the personal data that are floating around, I worry that the continued use of information as currency will bring about increasingly perverse incentives, more negative externalities, and greater asymmetries of power between corporations and individuals. There would surely be disadvantages to trading money instead of personal data for software services such as Facebook and Google. But in the long run, the world might be safer and better if the digital economy were to run on real money.
