It was a fantastic year for me. From January to April, I taught writing for a second semester at Niagara College, which went much more smoothly than my first semester. For one thing, I didn't have to create everything from scratch. For another, I resolved to be a merely effective teacher rather than a creative and original one. I'm not sure I inspired as many students in my second semester as in my first, but I left fewer of them behind.

I started looking for graduate programs in May, and by June I had enrolled in the new Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. I spent the rest of the summer doing data science courses on Coursera, and then drove across the continent with my dad at the end of August.

My first semester at UBC has been an absolute blast. I don't think I've ever learned so much in such a short period of time. Over the past four months, I've learned how to program in Python and R, how to create effective data visualizations, how to use important tools in software development, how to evaluate and improve algorithms, how to design and query from databases, and how to apply and interpret statistical analysis techniques for various problems.

One highlight was my course on Bayesian statistics. I'd already known the underlying philosophy for a couple years, and in a very simple sense, I'd been doing my best to <a href="https://youtu.be/BrK7X_XlGB8" target="_blank">think like a Bayesian</a>. But I didn't know any of the math beyond Bayes' Theorem itself; I didn't know how to extend the basic probabilistic concept to make inferences about statistical distributions. But now I do! And I love it. Imagine having a hero for a couple years, then meeting your hero and finding that not only are they a nice person, but they'd love to hang out with you several days a week. That's what it's been like, learning Bayesian statistics.

I read great books this year. Here are the ones that had an important impact on my philosophical development:
<ul>
	<li><i>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i>, by Douglas Hofstadter
<ul>
	<li>This is the most beautiful, mind-expanding, challenging book I've ever read. It raised the bar for "masterpiece."</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><i>The Righteous Mind</i>, by Jonathan Haidt
<ul>
	<li>This book changed the way I think about politics, and provided some extremely useful metaphors for understanding moral psychology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><em>How the Mind Works</em>, by Steven Pinker
<ul>
	<li>A densely-packed, sophisticated overview of evolutionary psychology and computational theory of mind, written by one of my favourite thinkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><i>Free Will</i>, by Sam Harris
<ul>
	<li>A short, convincing argument that the concept of free will is incoherent, and that that's totally fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Nick Bostrom's <em>Superintelligence</em> will also belong on this list, but I'm currently only halfway through. Here are a few other books I enjoyed:
<ul>
	<li><i>The Information</i>, by James Gleick</li>
	<li><i>Isaac Newton</i>, by James Gleick</li>
	<li><i>Waking Up</i>, by Sam Harris</li>
	<li><i>Influence</i>, by Robert Cialdini</li>
	<li><em>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em> by Richard Feynman</li>
	<li><em>Data and Goliath</em>, by Bruce Schneier</li>
	<li><em>Elon Musk</em><em>: Inventing the Future</em>, by Ashlee Vance</li>
</ul>

I also listened to a <em>lot</em> of music this year. This was the first year that I actively followed new music as it was released, and it was very rewarding. Here's my attempt at ranking my twenty favourite albums from this year:
<ol>
	<li>The Beautiful Game – Vulfpeck</li>
	<li>The Life of Pablo – Kanye West</li>
	<li>Malibu – Anderson .Paak</li>

	<li>You Want it Darker – Leonard Cohen</li>
	<li>A Moon-Shaped Pool – Radiohead</li>
</ol>
I think Run the Jewels 3, by Run the Jewels, will end up belonging on this list too, but it was just released today, and I wouldn't want to include it before listening to it for at least a few weeks.

I also discovered a bunch of amazing albums that were <em>not</em> released in 2016. Here are my favourites:
<ul>
	<li>Hamilton: An American Musical – Lin-Manuel Miranda</li>
	<li>Aja – Steely Dan</li>
	<li>Michigan – Sufjan Stevens</li>
	<li>The Meters – The Meters</li>
	<li>Romance Without Finance – Theo Katzman</li>
	<li>E-mo-tion – Carly Rae Jepsen</li>
	<li>Since I Left You – The Avalanches</li>
	<li>It’s Album Time – Todd Terje</li>
	<li>PHOX, by PHOX</li>
	<li>There's a Riot Goin' On – Sly & The Family Stone</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
These were my favourite movies this year:
<ol>
	<li>The Nice Guys</li>
	<li>Deadpool</li>
	<li>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</li>
	<li>Finding Dory</li>
</ol>
Lastly, I acquired a bunch of new beliefs, and changed my mind about others. I want to list these out, because it's good to make these things explicit. I've put my degree of confidence next to each statement.
<div>New beliefs I hold:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>The concept of free will is incoherent. (99%)</li>
	<li>There is an objective basis for morality, and it is subjective experience. (99%)</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence has the potential to be both drastically better and drastically worse for humanity than anything that came before. (90%)</li>
	<li>Prospect theory doesn't offer the best account of how framing affects judgments under uncertainty. The explicated valence account does. (95%)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Beliefs that I hold more strongly than I did last year:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>The end-goals of utilitarianism are not best achieved through local acts that maximize utility. (99%, up from 70%)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Beliefs that I hold less strongly than I did last year:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Democracy is the best possible way to distribute political power. (95%, down from 99%)</li>
	<li>Rule-based vegetarianism is the best way for me to eat ethically and healthily. (55%, down from 99%)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Things I’ve explicitly changed my mind about since last year:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Donald Trump is to be taken seriously as an existential threat. (80%, up from 5%)</li>
	<li>Donald Trump is not well-described as being "openly racist.” (95%, up from 20%)</li>
	<li>Some forms of both social and fiscal conservatism are good for society. (99%, up from 40%)</li>
	<li>Mitigating existential risk is more important than reducing global poverty. (80%, up from 40%)</li>
	<li>Avoiding eggs does more good than avoiding meat. (95%, up from 40%)</li>
	<li>Group selection acted on humans to produce groupish behaviour. (60%, up from 20%)</li>
</ul>
That's it for 2016. A few goals for the new year:
<ul>
	<li>Learn as much as possible about existential risk reduction, by reading through the Future of Humanity Institute's featured publications.</li>
	<li>Build a portfolio of extracurricular data science projects; specifically, push to GitHub at least five times a week.</li>
	<li>Post on my blog more often; specifically, post something once a month.</li>
	<li>Go to a data science meetup at least once every six weeks.</li>
</ul>
