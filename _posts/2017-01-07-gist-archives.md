<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/canada-shifting-position-un-declaration-indigenous-1.3571732">May 9th: Canada to implement indigenous rights declaration</a>

At the United Nations’ Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which begins today in New York City, Canada’s Indigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett will announce a formal shift in Canada’s stance on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The declaration was passed ten years ago by more than 140 countries — but not by the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

The Conservative government, in 2007, was concerned about provisions in the document relating to lands and resources. Canada endorsed the document in 2010, but also noted it was not legally binding. Soon after the 2015 election, Bennett announced that the Liberal government would implement the declaration as part of efforts to rebuild relationships with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples.

<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/leaked-ttip-documents-cast-doubt-on-eu-us-trade-deal">May 2nd: TTIP negotiation documents leaked</a>

Over the weekend, Greenpeace leaked a 248-page document containing notes on negotiations for the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). After TTIP talks in New York last week, Barack Obama said he was confident a deal could be reached. However, according to the notes, the US and the EU are at an impasse on several issues.

For example, the US wants to be forewarned of any planned regulations in the EU, and for US firms to have as much say as EU firms on those regulations. This would mean that American firms could influence several EU laws. More generally, critics of the TTIP worry—and with perhaps some justification, judging by the leaked notes—that the deal could erode protections for the environment and public health.

<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/five-hundred-minks-let-loose-in-ontario-police-probe-alleged-vandalism/article29816867/">Did you hear?</a> Late Friday night, 500 minks were let loose from a Southern Ontario fur farm. According to a farm spokesperson, who called this an act of animal rights extremism, some of the babies were likely separated from their mothers, a fact which should “weigh heavily on [the] conscience” of whoever precluded the young minks’ bright futures as really soft scarves.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-blood-services-plasma-pay-donate-1.3546487">April 27th: Blood agency considers paying donors</a>

Canada’s first paid blood clinic has opened in Saskatoon. Donors are given a $25 gift coupon in exchange for their blood. As a result, Canadian Blood Services, the agency that oversees the national supply of blood, is considering paying donors in an effort to increase plasma collection. Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott supports the idea.

Critics worry that paying donors may cause low-income individuals to compromise their health for money. There is also fear that a paid system will increase the risk of tainted blood donations. All donations have been voluntary in Canada since the 1980s, when more than 2,000 Canadians were infected with HIV and 30,000 more were infected with Hepatitis C from tainted blood products.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/airlines-insurance-war-risk-1.3547264">April 26th: Federal airline insurance program cancelled</a>

After the 9/11 attacks, insurance companies stopped providing war-risk insurance policies for airlines around the world. As a result, governments had to fill that need with taxpayer-supported coverage. Fifteen years later, Canada’s federal government is the only one in the world that still has an airline insurance program.

However, according to Transport Canada, the program will not be renewed upon its expiry on June 30<sup>th</sup>. The government has argued that private insurers are now offering sufficiently affordable premiums that there is no need for taxpayers to cover the risk of terrorist attacks.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/obama-germany-atlantic-trade-1.3550758">April 25th: Obama defends trans-Atlantic trade deal</a>

Over the weekend, Barack Obama made his last visit to Germany as president of the United States. He praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for welcoming hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into the country, saying she was “on the right side of history on this.” Obama also defended a trans-Atlantic trade deal that could be presented for ratification by the end of the year.

The deal, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), was protested by thousands of people at the Hannover Messe, the trade fair that Obama attended this weekend. Critics of the deal say it will only benefit multi-national corporations. However, Obama said it is “indisputable” that international trade strengthens the economy.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/solar-impulse-2-lands-california-1.3550698">Did you hear?</a> A solar-powered plane landed in California on Saturday night, after a 62-hour flight across the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii. The Solar Impulse 2 is on a trip around the world; it flies at 45 km/h, it is propelled entirely by electricity generated by sunlight, and it carries no fuel.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-impeachment-president-dilma-rousseff-1.3540647">April 19th: Brazil is a hot mess</a>

Late Sunday night, Brazil’s lower house of Congress voted 367-137 to impeach president Dilma Rousseff, who has been accused of (a) using illegal accounting tricks to balance the books and (b) being generally incompetent. Ironically, 60 per cent of the 594 members of Congress are implicated in a massive corruption scandal centred on the state-run Petrobras oil company.

In coming weeks, the Senate will likely vote to put Rousseff on trial. If that happens, her duties will be temporarily assumed by Vice President Michel Temer, who will take over permanently if Rousseff is found guilty. However, Temer is also facing corruption charges. If he is impeached, next in line is House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is also facing corruption charges. All in time for the Summer Olympics.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/parental-leave-for-dads-1.3540077">April 18th: Paternity leave is on the way</a>

The federal government will soon release details on new parental leave rules, which will likely include provisions for dedicated paternity leave. Currently, parents can take up to 35 weeks of leave between them, on top of 15 weeks that mothers can take on their own.

There is no word yet on how much time fathers could expect, but as a point of reference, in Quebec, fathers get five weeks leave with provincial benefits covering 70 per cent of their salary. On top of instituting paternity leave, the Liberals plan to make other reforms to the employment insurance system, including allowing parents to spread 12 months of parental benefits over 18 months, if they wish.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-tax-havens-offshore-1.3529931">April 12th: CRA to punish tax evaders</a>

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is hiring 100 auditors to crack down on tax cheats. The decision was influenced by the release of the Panama Papers, which exposed thousands of ultra-wealthy people who hide money in offshore tax havens. The CRA is spending $444 million in an effort to recoup an estimated $2.9 billion in added revenue over the next five years.

In the past, the government has required only that taxes evaded in this way be repaid; now the model will be more punitive, with the aim of deterring behaviour of this sort. Existing measures have collected more than $11 billion in taxes, penalties, and interest in 2015-16.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mulcair-ndp-leadership-1.3529013">April 11th: Mulcair rejected by NDP</a>

At the New Democratic Party’s biennial national convention, delegates voted in favour of a leadership race to replace Tom Mulcair. His leadership had been questioned since the loss of the election last October. He will remain leader until a replacement is chosen; the delegates voted to give the party two years to find someone new.

In a speech to the delegates before the vote, Mulcair accepted responsibility for the loss of the election, but focused mainly on the party’s goals for the future. He was greeted by a standing ovation, and delegates stood several times throughout the speech. NDP House leader Peter Julian said he believes that without Mulcair’s work in the House of Commons, Stephen Harper would still be prime minister.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/miscarriage-disability-human-rights-ontario-1.3517109">April 5th: Miscarriage recognized as disability</a>

In an interim decision, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario recently classified miscarriage as a disability. The tribunal is currently working through an employment discrimination case involving a Markham woman who was fired from her job in 2014 after she miscarried and then suffered from severe depression.

The classification of miscarriage as a disability sets a precedent for future cases, and could change how miscarriage is treated under provincial disability law. Many believe this will help to raise awareness of the issue—15 to 20 per cent of pregnancies end in miscarriages, and the reasons for them are rarely known.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/justin-trudeau-liberal-party-constitution-1.3518543">April 4th: Revised Liberal party constitution</a>

On Saturday, in a long speech to the Nova Scotia wing of the Liberal Party, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced support for a revised Liberal party constitution. It would allow anyone who registers with the party to nominate candidates and participate in policy development.

The long-held tradition is that only dues-paying, card-carrying members can participate in party activities. Because the new registration system would be free, the Liberal party would become less of an exclusive club and more of an open political movement. The new constitution will be reviewed at the party’s national convention in May.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/capitol-hill-shooting-1.3509677">March 29th: Police shoot suspect at Capitol Hill</a>

A man was shot by police at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. yesterday afternoon. He was in a visitor screening centre and appeared to be pointing a weapon at police. The weapon was recovered, and the man is now undergoing surgery. A bystander suffered minor injuries, but no police were hurt.

At a press conference, Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said the incident appears to be an isolated criminal act. There are unconfirmed reports that the man is the same one who was arrested at the Capitol last October for disrupting House proceedings. House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement thanking police.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/kashechewan-water-health-skin-rash-update-1.3500631">March 22nd: Keshechewan skin lesion outbreak</a>

There has been an outbreak of severe skin lesions in Keshechewan, a First Nations community in northern Ontario. Sixteen children are in need of immediate help. Many community members believe the local water is responsible, but Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott says the water was tested last Tuesday, and that it met safety standards.

Over a month has passed since multiple First Nations communities in northern Ontario declared a public health emergency. According to Sol Mamakwa, the health director for the Shibogama First Nations Council, the medical treatment of people in remote communities is “atrocious.”

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/proposed-beaufort-licences-infringe-arctic-sovereignty-1.3498469">March 21st: Beaufort Sea border dispute</a>

The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management recently issued a proposal for new oil and gas drilling leases in the Beaufort Sea. The proposal has reawakened a Canada-U.S. border dispute that dates back to 1825, when Yukon was owned by Britain, and Alaska was owned by Russia. The disputed region is wedge-shaped, and roughly the size of Lake Ontario.

The U.S. believes the maritime border should extend at ninety degrees to the shore, whereas Canada believes it should continue directly north, in line with the land border between Yukon and Alaska. Basically, the greatest threat to Canada-U.S. relations comes from a disagreement about the aesthetics of parallel and perpendicular lines.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cbc-news-online-commenting-no-pseudonyms-1.3496467">Did you hear?</a> Last week, the CBC announced a new policy for comments on its online stories: no more anonymity. The top comment on that story got 1140 likes: “I like my privacy, so that will be the end of my commenting on this website. Buh bye CBC.”

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/charles-sousa-guaranteed-income-1.3490107">March 15th: Liberals will test guaranteed minimum income</a>

Buried in the Ontario Liberals’ budget, published last month, there is a paragraph stating an intention to experiment with guaranteed minimum income. Charles Souza, the finance minister, said a pilot project should be expected sometime this fall, but that the test community had not yet been selected.

Many believe such a system would be better for two main reasons. One, in comparison to the current set of social programs, guaranteed minimum income would be a more efficient and humane way to lift up the 9% of Canadians who live in poverty. Second, because poverty has such a negative effect on health, minimum income would reduce health care costs.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/go-google-alphago-lee-sedol-deepmind-1.3488913">March 13th: AlphaGo beats world champion</a>

Over the past week, world-champion Go-player Lee Se-dol has been facing off against AlphaGo, Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence machine. Just months ago, many believed it would be another ten years before artificial intelligence could contend with the best Go players; as of this week, AlphaGo <em>is</em> the best Go player.

In Go, each player places stones on a 19-by-19 grid, with the aim of surrounding vacant areas. The game is strategically monstrous; at each turn, there are roughly 100 possible moves. This is why human-like intuition has staved off machine competitors for so long. AlphaGo’s victory is a major landmark in artificial intelligence, and at every level of expertise in the field, there’s as much excitement as there is worry.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wage-gap-oxfam-1.3478938">March 8th: Wage gap is widening</a>

A report released yesterday by Oxfam Canada and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives paints a troubling picture of the gender wage gap in Canada. After the global financial crisis in 2009, Canadian women made 74.4¢ for every dollar made by men—keeping constant the number of hours worked, the years of experience, and the level of education. In 2010, they made 73.6¢. Since 2011, they’ve held steady at 72¢.

What’s more, women in Canada do almost twice as much unpaid labour as men. While women spend 3-6 hours per day on domestic chores such as laundry, cooking, and cleaning, men spend 30 minutes to 2 hours. In developing countries, the systemic imbalance is even worse.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/assisted-suicide-archdiocese-toronto-1.3478091">March 7th: Archbishop criticizes physician-assisted death</a>

In a video posted yesterday that was shown in more than 200 Catholic churches across Toronto, Archbishop Thomas Collins criticized upcoming legislation that will expand Canadians’ access to physician-assisted death. He accused the government of religious discrimination, and said the proposals should “shock us to the core.”

He was referring to a 70-page report tabled by a parliamentary committee on February 25<sup>th</sup>. It argued that minors and the mentally ill should not be excluded from the right to physician-assisted death, and that physicians who are personally unwilling to perform the service should be forced to refer the patient to a physician who will.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/truck-plunges-deline-ice-road-1.3477869">Did you hear?</a> A fuel tanker broke through the ice at a crossing of Great Bear Lake, near Deline, North-West Territories. A specialized crew will work to freeze it in place, transfer the fuel to another tanker, and then try to remove the truck from the ice.

<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-to-run-18-billion-deficit-plus-billions-in-new-spending/article28833722/">February 23rd: Liberals predict triple-sized deficit</a>

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is projecting a budget deficit that is three times larger than what the Liberals promised during the election campaign. Because of the plunge of the loonie, Parliament must now argue over whether the Liberals’ mandate is to keep the deficit under $10 billion, as promised, or to follow through on infrastructure investments and other stimuli, as promised.

The Liberals won’t release the details of their budget until March 22<sup>nd</sup>, but economists say the early adjustment to the deficit projection likely includes a cushion in case the economy doesn’t rally in coming years. In anything but a worst-case scenario, this would make the Liberals look good, so some believe Morneau is using premature pessimism as a political tactic.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/san-bernardino-victims-apple-iphone-unlock-1.3457926">February 23rd: The messy ethics of encryption</a>

Last week, the U.S. government issued a court order to access encrypted data on the iPhones of the San Bernardino terrorists. But there’s a problem: Apple made its encryption so strong that not even Apple itself can bypass it—at least, not without building the necessary technology, which Apple refuses to do.

Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, says the existence of such a key could compromise the security of customers’ data. Understandably, many of the San Bernardino victims feel differently; they want to know why they were targeted. Several victims will soon file a legal brief in support of the government.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-canada-isis-fight-announcement-1.3438279">February 9th: Canada’s updated military plans</a>

Yesterday, Justin Trudeau made his first major foreign policy decisions as prime minister. Most notably, he committed to ceasing airstrikes in Iraq and Syria by February 22<sup>nd</sup>. Conservative Party leader Rona Ambrose called this a “shameful step backward.”

However, Trudeau also committed to tripling, from 69, the number of Canadian Forces members helping to train local ground troops to fight ISIS in northern Iraq. He’ll also send an additional 230 members to join the 800 who have already been deployed as part of a coalition mission.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/meteorite-death-1.3438300">Did you hear?</a> A meteorite is suspected of having killed a man in India. Scientists are analysing samples from the dark blue diamond-like stone that was found in the crater at the scene. There have been no meteorite deaths since 1825.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-rocket-launch-window-1.3437423">February 8th: North Korea launches rocket</a>

Despite international warnings, North Korea launched a rocket on Saturday. The country claims the launch was part of its peaceful space program, but many believe it was a covert missile test. The United States and Japan have called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

Last month, North Korea claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb. Tests like these, whether or not they are successful (or real), are intended to bring the country closer to nuclear armament. The international community will likely counter with tougher economic sanctions.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/monsef-electoral-reform-changes-referendum-1.3428593">February 2nd: Monsef plans electoral reform</a>

Maryam Monsef, the Democratic Institutions Minister, confirmed in an interview that the Liberal Party is committed to electoral reform. Throughout last fall’s election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeatedly promised that if the Liberals were to win, then it would be Canada’s last election under the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system.

Monsef is under pressure from the Conservatives to call for a referendum on whatever changes she ultimately proposes. While polls indicate that well under 50% of Canadians support reform, Monsef argued that Canadians already gave their mandate by electing a Liberal majority. Ironically, if it weren’t for FPTP, the Liberals wouldn’t <em>have</em> a majority. In democracy, sometimes it’s hard to separate incentives from ideals.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/genetic-discrimination-bill-s201-1.3425408">February 1st: Genetic Non-Discrimination Act</a>

The Senate is currently reviewing Bill S-201, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act. The bill will prevent insurance companies, employers, and other third parties from accessing the results of genetic tests. Such tests, usually cheap and simple to undergo, are often foregone by patients for fear of discrimination.

Bioethicists say the bill is long overdue, and will become increasingly important as genetic tests become more prevalent and their results become more telling. If the bill passes, Canada will have followed in the footsteps of all other G7 countries, which have already passed laws against genetic discrimination.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vote-none-of-the-above-byelection-1.3426783">Did you hear?</a> A Whitby-Oshawa man has legally changed his name so that it will appear at the bottom of the ballots in the municipality’s upcoming byelection. His new name: Above Znoneofthe.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/speeding-tickets-police-radar-testing-1.3415927">January 26th: Radar guns inconsistently tested</a>

CBC News has learned that for the past decade, police forces across Canada have been using different testing procedures on the same radar guns. The standard procedure is to calibrate the guns by striking a tuning fork at a set frequency. Because the guns’ margin of error is around two kilometres per hour, this discovery has cast doubt on the validity of millions of speeding tickets.

According to the former speed-management coordinator who allowed the OPP to stop performing the tests, there used to be concerns that officers were perjuring themselves by claiming to have properly performed a test that they didn’t fully understand. Whoever explained the test to these officers probably should have slowed down.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/weather-temporarily-delays-brad-wall-visit-to-la-loche-following-shootings-1.3417814">January 25th: Mass shooting in La Loche</a>

On Friday, there was a mass shooting in La Loche, a small northern community in Saskatchewan. Four people were killed, two at a home and two at a high school, where seven others were injured. A 17-year-old suspect is under custody and will be in court today, facing four charges of first-degree murder and seven charges of attempted murder.

Saskatchewan’s Premier Brad Wall visited the community yesterday. He pledged to fund counselling for victims’ family members. La Loche’s mayor and its MP are also asking for funding to have the school torn down and rebuilt, and to make other improvements to community infrastructure. They worry that this will be much harder to achieve once the media spotlight turns away.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/swedish-tv-mixes-up-political-debate-with-children-s-show-subtitles-1.3415817">Did you hear?</a> A televised Swedish political debate got goofy last week when the TV network mixed up the subtitles with those of a children’s show. “Greetings, earth creature,” said the Minister for the Environment. “I will build the best sand castle in the galaxy!” said the leader of the Liberal party.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/clinton-sanders-debate-primaries-1.3407915">January 19th: Final Democratic primary debate</a>

Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O’Malley met on Sunday evening for the final Democratic primary debate. As expected, most of the debate centred on Clinton and Sanders, who are in a tight race for the nomination.

The frontrunners stuck to their strengths, Sanders by focusing on inequality, and Clinton by associating herself with Obama’s legacy. Clinton also accused Sanders of being too soft on gun control. In response, he pointed to his lifetime rating of D- from the National Rifle Association—probably the only situation in which a low grade is good for one’s job prospects. Democratic primary voting begins in Iowa next month.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/syria-isis-1.3407619">January 18<sup>th</sup>: ISIS attacks Deir el-Zour</a>

Multiple news organizations reported on Sunday that ISIS carried out a coordinated massacre in the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. Hundreds were killed, and hundreds more have likely been taken hostage.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 135 were killed—around 80 of them pro-government militiamen and the rest civilians—and added that most were shot or beheaded. The Syrian government, in contrast, said 300 were killed, mostly elderly people, women, and children. According to a Lebanese news organization, more than 400 people have been taken hostage.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-frees-prisoners-1.3407089">Did you hear?</a> The International Atomic Energy Agency announced yesterday that Iran has fulfilled all the commitments it made in the nuclear deal last summer. The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed that the crippling sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program will be lifted immediately.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-care-high-cost-users-1.3398628">January 12th: Medical expenses highly concentrated</a>

According a report released yesterday by the Canadian Medical Association, one percent of Canadians account for over a third of medical expenses. The findings were based on 15 million Ontarians who were eligible for health-care funding between 2009 and 2011. The study’s aim was to help plan policies to better meet patient needs.

The costs are different among the age groups. For children and teens, nearly 40 percent of spending was focused on the top one percent. For ages 18 to 64, 36 percent of spending was focused on the top one percent. And for those over age 65, 16 percent of spending was focused on the top one percent.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/dollar-loonie-oil-wti-1.3398756">Did you hear?</a> Yesterday oil prices dropped to $31 a barrel, the lowest level since 2002. This has pulled the loonie down dangerously close to 70¢ US. Meanwhile the Toronto Stock Exchange is down 20% from its September peak.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cologne-assaults-1.3396921">January 11th: Riots in Cologne</a>

On Saturday, riot police clashed with 1700 protesters in Cologne, a city in western Germany. The protesters were part of an anti-Islamic group called PEGIDA, which, in German, stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. Some protesters threw firecrackers and beer bottles at police, who responded with water cannons and tear gas. No injuries were reported.

After a series of potentially coordinated sexual assaults and robberies in Cologne on New Years Eve—blamed mostly on foreigners—PEGIDA demanded stricter laws on refugees. During the protest on Saturday, they chanted, “Merkel must go,” referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was the main political force welcoming 1.1 million immigrants, mostly Syrian refugees, to Germany in 2015.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-stock-prices-1.3388119">January 5th: Stock markets lurch into 2016</a>

It’s been a rough start to the new year for stock markets across the world. The Toronto Stock Exchange and the Dow Jones (the Canadian and American benchmark indices) were down one and two percent, respectively, after the first day of trading in 2016.

The slump is thought to have been caused by a 6.9% drop in China, which prompted the country to suspend trading for the rest of the day. Such suspensions are called ‘circuit breakers’: they are emergency measures to be taken in times of high volatility. While most stock markets have had circuit breakers in place for some time, China only announced theirs late last year; this was their first time using one.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-ad-muslim-ban-1.3389107">Did you hear?</a> With the American presidential primaries beginning in just four weeks, Donald Trump has released his first campaign ad. It highlights his plan to build a wall along the border of Mexico—using footage from Morocco.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-mayor-murder-1.3387441">January 4th: Mexico mayor murdered</a>

Gisella Mota, a Mexican mayor, was killed on Saturday after her first day in office. Gunmen entered her home in Temixco, a city of 100,000, south of Mexico City. The state government said two presumed assailants were killed, and three others were detained after a pursuit—they had fired on federal police and soldiers from a vehicle.

Mota’s leftist Democratic Revolution Party described her as “a strong and brave woman who, on taking office as mayor, declared that her fight against crime would be frontal and direct.” Temixco is home to the Public Security Commission, which coordinates state and local police forces; it is also sandwiched between the city of Cuernavaca and the state of Guerrero, which are both fraught with organized crime.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-nuclear-deal-uranium-shipped-1.3382394">December 29th: Iran relinquishes enriched uranium</a>

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Monday that more than 11 tonnes of enriched uranium were aboard a ship from Iran to Russia. This fulfils one of the most significant commitments made by Iran in the deal that was struck on July 14<sup>th</sup>, which aims to increase the time Iran would need in order to build a nuclear bomb.

Iran will also reduce its number of centrifuges, which can be used to enrich uranium, and will cut its production of plutonium—another route to armament. Once all the requirements of the deal have been met, most international sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program will be lifted. This is expected in the next month.

She was selected for putting a female face to indigenous leadership as the first ever woman to be elected grand chief of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, a non-profit organization that represents 30 Manitoba First Nations.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/evictions-business-booming-oil-slump-1.3378567">December 28th: Albertan repossession companies thrive</a>

Revenue in Alberta’s civil enforcement industry is up 25% since April. Because of the oil slump’s weakening effect on the economy, more Albertans are defaulting on their loans. This means there’s more business for companies like Consolidated Recovery Group and Allied Shortridge Civil Enforcement, both of which work with lenders and courts to recover bad debts.

According to executives at these companies, neither they nor their bailiffs relish the sensitive work; they approach each repossession as an opportunity to help the debtor save face—if the debtor is cooperative. First to go are the toys: “the motorcycles, the fifth-wheel trailer, the campers, the cottage.”

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-fertility-clinics-1.3374634">December 22nd: Ontario fertility clinics</a>

50 publicly funded fertility clinics opened across Ontario yesterday. The clinics will offer one cycle of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and unlimited artificial insemination free of charge to all eligible families, including single parents and same-sex couples. Women must be under the age of 43 to participate.

It is estimated that one in six families in Ontario are affected by infertility at some point in their lives. The $50 million in funding, added to $20 million spent yearly on IFV treatments already under OHIP, will help roughly 5,000 families to conceive a child.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/clinton-sanders-democratic-debate-1.3373443">December 21st: Third Democratic primary debate</a>

Saturday night was the third presidential primary debate for the remaining Democratic candidates: front-runner Hillary Clinton, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. Sanders opened with an apology to Clinton for a breach of her campaign’s voter data last week. She accepted, eager to discuss more pressing issues.

One such issue is foreign policy. Clinton was vociferous in her denouncement of Donald Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling him ISIS’s “best recruiter.” Here Sanders was out of his element, having built his campaign around economic inequality. O’Malley was aggressive throughout the debate—understandably so, because nobody is paying him any attention.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-final-report-1.3361148">December 15th: Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future</a>

Over the past six years, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has heard testimonies from over 6,000 indigenous men and women who survived physical and sexual abuse in Canada’s residential school system. Today the commission releases its final report, documenting the mistreatment of over 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children, of which 3,200 were found to have died of diseases resulting from poor living conditions.

According to the chair of the commission, “Every social condition measurable in Canadian society places aboriginal people at the most disadvantaged position of all people in the country. […] It is clear that residential schools were a key component of a Canadian governmental policy of cultural genocide.” In June, the commission made 94 recommendations, all of which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has committed to implementing.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-liberal-taxes-middle-class-1.3353939">December 8th: Liberals tax cuts for middle class</a>

Finance Minister Bill Morneau confirmed the Liberals’ plan to reduce taxes for those earning between $45,282 and $90,563 per year. He also confirmed that the yearly contribution limit to the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) will be reduced from $10,000 to $5,500. Both changes will take effect at the beginning of 2016.

To make up for some of the lost revenue from the middle class, taxes will be hiked for the richest 1%. However, the restructuring might not be revenue-neutral. Morneau’s critics worry that the government is digging itself too deep into debt. With a $10 billion deficit, it will be a long road to a balanced budget.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/hot-lanes-del-duca-1.3353214">December 7th: That HOT-lane plan.</a>

The Ontario government will release details today about its plan to introduce high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes to the provincial highway network. Motorists will be allowed to pay to use existing High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) lanes, which can currently be used only by vehicles with two or more passengers.

Headed by Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca, the plan has been denounced by the two opposition parties at Queen’s Park. Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown said, “We shouldn’t be taxing existing roadways.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath called the lanes ‘Lexus lanes’—suggesting that only the wealthiest motorists will be able to use them.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/td-visa-clients-browsing-open-to-surveillance-by-bank-1.3339148">December 1st: TD Visa fine print not so fine</a>

18 months ago, a privacy specialist from B.C. complained to TD after reading in the bank’s 66-page Visa cardholder agreement that they could collect the following information:
<ul>
	<li>“Details about your browsing activity on your browser or mobile device.</li>
	<li>Your preferences and activities.”</li>
</ul>
Because the bank delayed so long in changing the agreement, the B.C. man took the story to the CBC. TD has since removed the first clause, and said in a statement that “TD has never, at any time, collected general information regarding details about customers’ browsing activity, their browser or mobile device.”

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ministers-refugee-processing-centre-jordan-1.3342699">November 30th: Refugee processing centre in Jordan</a>

Yesterday, three Canadian ministers were present for the opening of a registration centre in Amman, Jordan. The centre will likely become the hub of the resettlement program that aims to bring 25,000 refugees to Canada by the end of February. The centre processed 90 people yesterday, and soon will be processing up to 500 per day.

Health Minister Jane Philpott said she was struck by the scope of the issue. Many of the 25,000 refugees bound for Canada will come from the Zaatari camp, which currently has 80,000 residents. 153 Syrian refugees have come to Canada since November 4<sup>th</sup>, and an additional 928 have been issued visas.

The Canadian military has been accused of killing at least five civilians in an airstrike in northern Iraq on November 19<sup>th</sup>. Iraqi media reports say the strike successfully destroyed an ISIS bomb-making factory, killing all militants inside, but also damaged a nearby dairy factory, killing between 5 and 13 civilians and injuring at least a dozen.

Despite Justin Trudeau’s promise to remove the CF-18 fighter jets from the throng, the Canadian Air Force has conducted 16 strikes since the election on October 19<sup>th</sup>, adding to almost 200 in the past year. Major-General Chuck Lamarre, a chief of staff with the military, has said he is confident that no civilians were harmed in the strike last week.

Just days before the Paris summit on climate change, Alberta’s NDP government has announced an economy-wide carbon tax. As part of a general strategy to confront climate change, the tax is accompanied by a 15-year plan to phase out coal, and also a 10-year plan to halve methane emissions.

Carbon emissions themselves will likely not diminish any time soon; the new plan sets a cap at 100 megatonnes, well above the 70 megatonnes currently produced. Still, the tax revenue will be reinvested in technology to fight pollution. The plan has received a generally positive response, even from some petroleum and oil sands executives.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-russia-trudeau-putin-ukraine-1.3321069">November 17th: Trudeau meets Putin</a>

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been making headlines all week at the G20 summit in Antalya, Turkey. After reaffirming Canada’s commitment to the fight against ISIS, and after smiling time and again for dozens of selfie-seeking delegates, Trudeau told reporters yesterday that he’d had a chat with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It was not a friendly chat.

In keeping with his stance throughout the election campaign, which involved calling Putin a bully, Trudeau told the Russian president to lay off interference in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Paul Grod, congratulated Trudeau, and urged Canada to go one step further and impose sectoral sanctions on Russia.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/mosque-peterborough-fire-1.3320013">November 16th: Peterborough mosque set ablaze</a>

Police are investigating a case of arson that occurred late Saturday night at a mosque in Peterborough, Ontario. Nobody was in the building at the time, but the fire caused $80,000 in smoke damage. As of yesterday evening, a community crowdfunding campaign had raised over $20,000 to restore the mosque.

Kenze Abdella, the president of the Kawartha Muslim Religious Association, says the act was “clearly a hate crime.” The association has been targeted by criminals only once since it was founded in 1994: its previous building’s windows were smashed out after 9/11.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/judge-removal-canadian-judicial-council-1.3314962">November 13th: Conduct of Alberta judge under review</a>

On Monday, the Judicial Council of Canada announced that it was reviewing the conduct of Robin Camp, an Alberta judge. In 2014, Camp presided over the case of a 19-year-old woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted by a Calgary man at a house party. Camp asked her, “Why couldn’t you just keep your knees together?”

Since the judicial council’s creation in 1971, only two judges have been recommended for removal. Norman Sabourin, the council’s executive director, said in an interview with CBC News on Tuesday that the main concern is whether the judge can maintain the confidence of the public. If the council recommends that Camp be removed, the decision will ultimately be made by parliament.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/immigration-minister-john-mccallum-1.3310839">November 10th: Liberal refugee plan reaffirmed</a>

Immigration Minister John McCallum confirmed in a press conference last night that the Liberal government will stay true to its promise to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada by the end of 2015. A cabinet committee has been formed, and its first meeting is tomorrow.

The plan, at the moment, is to focus mostly on refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. There are few details yet on how the refugees will be transported here, and also on where they will be housed once they arrive. The overall estimated cost is around $200 million, half of which will go directly to the United Nations’ relief efforts.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-trudeau-liberal-cabinet-ministers-1.3302743">November 5th: Prime Minister Trudeau and his new cabinet</a>

Yesterday Justin Trudeau was sworn in as Canada’s 23<sup>rd</sup> prime minister. In his address, he promised to rebuild relations with indigenous Canadians and to run an ethical and transparent government. He also introduced a diverse cabinet that he says “looks like Canada.” When asked why it was so important to him to have an equal number of male and female ministers, he responded, “because it’s 2015.”

It’s not just the ministers that changed; it’s also the cabinet configuration. A science portfolio was introduced, and some titles were renamed—for example, the Minister of Environment <em>and Climate Change</em>. Trudeau said he plans to recall Parliament by early December.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/elementary-teachers-ontario-deadline-1.3299362">November 3rd: Ontario elementary teachers reach tentative agreement</a>

It can be annoying when people interpret things too literally, and that’s whole point of the Ontario elementary teachers’ work-to-rule campaign. Work-to-rule is a softer version of a strike; it means workers do no more than the minimum required by the rules of their contracts. The campaign began in May, and last week the provincial government was preparing to dock teachers’ pay.

But yesterday the government reached a tentative deal with the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO). The ETFO is now advising its 78,000 members—including both teachers and support staff—to go back to business as usual. It’s great news for everyone, especially the kids.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hydro-rate-increase-1.3298396">November 2nd: Ontario hydro rates: charge on up</a>

On October 15<sup>th</sup> the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) announced a hydro rate hike, which went into effect yesterday. The average household electricity bill is expected to rise by 3.4 per cent, continuing a steady upward trend over the past five years. In 2010 the average monthly bill was $100; now it is $131.

According to the OEB, the hike was caused by rising costs from nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, as well as costs from renewable sources like wind and solar. Prices will increase again on January 1<sup>st</sup>, when the 10 per cent discount from the Clean Energy Benefit will end. Many consumers are angry, but few are shocked.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/earthquake-afghanistan-pakistan-india-1.3288323">October 27th: Earthquake hits South Asia</a>

Yesterday a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, killing at least 263 people and injuring over 1000. The quake, centred deep beneath the Hindu Kush mountains, also reached bordering regions in Pakistan, India, and Tajikistan. It shook buildings, knocked out power, and caused a stampede that killed 12 schoolgirls. Many in the region will have slept outdoors last night, wary of aftershocks.

Of the confirmed deaths, most occurred in Islamabad and Kabul, the respective capitals of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Authorities are struggling to reach the victims who live in Afghanistan’s remote northern regions, some of which are controlled by the Taliban. The death count is expected to rise.

For the first time, scientists are witnessing the death of a solar system. The event was spotted using NASA’s Kepler telescope, which measures the subtle dimming that occurs when a planet passes in front of a star. Every 4.5 hours, the light of the star in question—a tiny Earth-sized star at the end of its life—dims by a whopping 40 percent.

The research team has determined that the solar system’s last planet is shredding and collapsing under the star’s gravity, orbiting closer and closer like a trail of soap bubbles circling a drain. That’s us someday. Happy Monday!

On September 17<sup>th</sup> a judge in rural Alabama compelled 500 defendants to donate blood to avoid going to jail. The defendants, many of them poor, owed fines for various crimes such as assault, hunting after dark, and possession of drugs. They were told that donating a pint of blood would result in a $100 discount on their debt.

The Southern Poverty Law Centre, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization, has filed an ethics complaint against the judge, saying the order was a “violation of bodily integrity.” LifeSouth, the blood bank that ran the drive, later quarantined, tested, and ultimately discarded nearly all the blood units. To make matters worse, the defendants didn’t get their discounts. Only in rural Alabama.

Today is the federal election. According to the polls, the race is still close enough that the winning party will probably win with a minority. This means the next few months could be tumultuous. To form government, a party must win and hold the confidence of the House of Commons. This is doable but not stable, and it rarely lasts a full four-year term.

What if the governing party loses the confidence of the house? The Governor General must then decide whether to give another party (or coalition) the opportunity to form government, or else to dissolve Parliament and call for another election. Oof. For now, let’s make this one count. Nag your friends!

Before serving on an Ontario jury, you have to fill out a questionnaire to confirm that you're not a convicted criminal. But if you've committed a summary offence (a minor crime that doesn't go to trial) you might still be eligible. To report this on the questionnaire, you refer to a list of potentially exemptible offences.

Ontario lawyers just noticed that since 2010, that list has included at least three offences that occasionally do go to trial. Oops. This means some of our jurors have been in court before—for the wrong reason. The Attorney General Ministry is fixing the problem, which is good, because justice probably shouldn’t be quite this blind.

Yesterday Canada and eleven other countries agreed to the terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Together these countries constitute roughly 60% of global GDP, making this the largest free trade agreement in history. The terms will be reviewed by parliament after the federal election on October 19<sup>th</sup>.

Stephen Harper says the TPP will help create 1.2 million net new jobs by 2020. Justin Trudeau is confidently pro-trade, but hesitated to comment further until learning more details. Tom Mulcair criticized Harper for negotiating behind closed doors, and called for him to release the full text of the agreement before the election. David Laing cannot help but read ‘TPP’ as ‘Toilet Paper Party.’

On Friday Telus announced plans to invest $1 billion in a fibre optic network in Vancouver. After testing out similar networks in smaller B.C. communities, the company now plans to invest an additional $4 billion over the next four years to upgrade the communications infrastructure all across the province.

Telus’s spokesperson Luiza Staniec compared the upgrade to expanding a three-lane highway to five lanes. It will help meet the rising demand for mobile internet usage, and will make it easier for Telus’s residential and business customers to send large files at high speed. It should benefit health care, education, and technology sectors.

Yesterday’s mass shooting in Oregon confirms what we already know: the world is an ugly place. Islamic State is murdering everyone. The Syrian civil war has displaced millions of refugees. A billion people live in extreme poverty. Every day, tens of thousands of children die of preventable diseases.

But we forget: the world is far better than it used to be. Since 1990, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by half. Maternal and childhood mortality rates have dropped even more. Literacy, primary education, gender equality, family planning—up up up up. There’s a long way to go, but already we’ve come far. Don’t let your inner cynic forget it.

Say you spend a few loonies on a carton of American milk. The value of your milk will disappear as soon as you drink it, but the value of your money will persist long into the future—just not in your hands. So, if you trade Canadian money for a foreign good, you’re sending real, persistent value from this country to another. Ouch, says every Canadian dairy farmer.

Governments can protect domestic industries by taxing foreign goods. But then: ouch, says every multi-national corporation. Enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership—a proposal to lower trade barriers between several countries around the Pacific Rim. This week, Stephen Harper will negotiate with other leaders to determine whether Canada will participate. Big corporations are salivating. Domestic workers are nervous.

We’ve known for decades that there is water on Mars. We’ve known only since yesterday that some of it is liquid. Well, probably. NASA released a statement saying they’ve analysed photos of small trails that appear on certain dunes. They say the trails are carved out by salty rivulets that flow down the slopes each summer.

Though the evidence is indirect, it’s exciting news. Liquid water is necessary for life, so this raises the chances that one day we’ll bring back a test tube full of microbial aliens. For now, Hollywood is pleased: it’s hard to imagine a better teaser for this week’s premiere of The Martian.

Broadly, there are two ways a country can reduce carbon emissions: (1) use a straight tax, where organizations pay the government directly for all emissions; or (2) use a cap-and-trade system, where the government sets a ‘cap’ on the country’s total emissions by selling a set number of permits, which can then be traded between organizations at a price determined by the market.

Tom Mulcair announced on Sunday that he would introduce a national cap-and-trade system. Most people who know what that means believe it would incentivize reductions better than a straight tax would. Of course, not everybody knows what it means—and that makes the usual squabbling a bit more amusing.

At least once during their lifetime, every Muslim must travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the holy pilgrimage that happens there once a year. This year’s pilgrimage has seen two disasters so far. Two weeks ago a crane collapsed and killed 111 people, and yesterday two massive crowds crossed paths in a tight intersection, resulting in a horrific stampede that killed at least 719 and injured at least 863. When 2 million people converge in the same small valley, all hoping to perform the same rites at the same time, “logistical nightmare” takes on a whole new meaning.

Yesterday Pope Francis arrived in the United States for his first ever visit to the country. He’s a tremendously important religious leader, but that isn’t the only reason the world will watch him closely for the next six days. He was tactful last week when he addressed the Cuban leaders Fidel and Raúl Castro, with whom President Obama hopes to soothe relations. This may have been what earned him the rare honour of a personal welcome from Obama at the home of the presidential air fleet. Tomorrow he will address Congress, and many expect him to call for a greater commitment to humanitarianism.

When fourteen-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested last week for bringing a self-made clock to school, we all got our dose of outrage. And that’s fine. The arrest was clearly a mistake. But on Sunday, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins tweeted links to sources that suggest Mohamed didn’t actually make anything; he just removed the casing from a store-made clock. If this is true, Dawkins asked, what were the boy’s motives? Likely innocuous, but who’s to say? The point is, just because Mohamed didn’t make a bomb—and, to be clear, he didn’t—that doesn’t mean he was honest throughout the affair. Racial profiling isn’t the only way we rocket-launch to conclusions.

For the first time in Canadian history, the results of the federal election may depend significantly on the votes of First Nations people. Historically, leaders of the +600 indigenous groups have discouraged their people from voting because the government treats them with so little respect. But because this election is so unpredictable, and because each party has promised different things to First Nations people—or else nothing at all, cough, Conservatives—many First Nations leaders are ushering their people out to the ballot boxes. It’s the dream of democracy, at least in theory: if the government doesn’t respect you, get a new government. Next month, it could make all the difference.

After Greece’s third national vote of the year, Alexis Tsipras was re-elected as prime minister. He and his left-wing Syriza party managed to win a comfortable minority with 35.5 percent of the vote, despite Tsipras’s U-turn on austerity measures earlier this summer. His job won’t be easy. After the chaotic negotiation of the $86 billion bailout package from Greece’s creditors, Tsipras must now pass many unpopular laws before the end of the year. He must also contend with the growing refugee crisis. If nearby countries start to block off their borders, and if refugees continue to land on Greek shores, Tsipras may soon wish this weekend’s vote had gone another way.

The right to religious expression is often at odds with issues of protocol. For example, yesterday we covered a story about a Muslim woman who wished be veiled during a public oath-taking ceremony. It’s more rare, though, that the right to religious expression butts heads with other rights, as it has recently done at Memorial University in St. John’s. A professor there has cited religion in her refusal to wear a microphone for a student with impaired hearing. Yes, you heard that right. Apparently, this isn’t the first time the professor has fought this noble sartorial battle—and won. The student dropped the course, and the university hasn’t intervened. Cue the down-votes.

Reg Sherren, a CBC journalist, recently noticed that his Facebook profile had mysteriously liked the Conservative Party of Canada. After a bit of sleuthing, he learned that malware embedded in certain websites can cause you to like a page unknowingly. Realizing the implications, Sherren asked each major political party whether they have ever paid third-party sites to embed this malware. Liberals: nope. NDP: no sir. Green: no way! Conservatives: “Thanks for reaching out to us. On this question, it’s an internal party matter.” Good thing Harper & Co have that wholesome public image to fall back on.

The Globe and Mail will soon host the next major parliamentary debate, but this time only the big boys (Harper, Trudeau, and Mulcair) are invited. Elizabeth May, never one to sulk, has teamed up with Twitter to help her cyber-crash the party and add some green décor. For every question posed to the other candidates, May will tweet a video response in real time.

Her exclusion may seem unfair, but it likely has little to do with her platform; instead, the Globe probably just wants to let viewers focus on the candidates who have a realistic chance of forming government. Of course, May’s views are still valuable, so listen for the tweets—or, more appropriately, the chirps.

This summer the Winnipeg Free Press radically changed its pricing scheme. In addition to offering a monthly subscription fee, which gives readers access to all online content, the newspaper now offers readers the option of paying a small fee—27¢—for each article. The newspaper’s publisher, Bob Cox, says that so far this has helped the newspaper adapt to the shift in demand from print to online. It’s not hard to imagine why: most readers have selective interests, and few have the desire or the time to read every single article. Enter micropayments, and…well…The Gist.

As Canadians, we like to think of ourselves as global benefactors, upholding international peace agreements and generously dispensing foreign aid. But a recent study by the Canadian International Council shows that our self-image is distorted. Compared with the G7 and with other medium-sized democracies, we’re downright stingy when it comes to global engagement. Our parliamentary candidates all promise different versions of improvement, but for us to reclaim our once-held position as a leader in global engagement, we would have to double our spending on defence, foreign aid, diplomacy, and the environment. Realistically, that won’t happen any time soon.

Joy Davies, a B.C. Liberal candidate, caused trouble for Justin Trudeau yesterday when her views on marijuana caught the attention of the media. She had posted on Facebook that marijuana might cause a decrease in domestic violence, and that a mother can increase the IQ of her child by consuming marijuana during pregnancy. Trudeau went on record to say that the Liberal Party does support the legalization of marijuana, but for a different reason: the drug is already used by many Canadians, especially young ones, so the current system grants the government none of the benefits of regulation, and in the meantime it funds criminals. Davies resigned later in the day.

Although it is now nearly certain that the nuclear deal will pass, the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, has ruled out further negotiations with the United States, calling the Western superpower the “Great Satan.” In comments published on Wednesday, he also responded to claims that the deal will keep Israeli Jews safe for the next 25 years; by that time, he says, those Jews won’t even exist. Coming from Khamenei, militant statements like these make supporters of the nuclear deal look unwise. Unsurprisingly, those who oppose the deal take this as evidence that Iran cannot be trusted.

<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/mulcair-promises-to-boost-canadas-aerospace-industry/article26247461/">September 9th: Mulcair promises to boost aerospace industry</a>

Tom Mulcair, the leader of the NDP, promised on Tuesday to boost Canada’s aerospace industry, a sector that has seen hundreds of layoffs this year. He says he will institute a four-year fund, worth $160 million, to help Canadian aerospace companies compete globally, and he’ll set aside another $40 million for the Canadian Space Agency’s technology development program. As the parliamentary election campaign continues, both Mulcair and Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberals, are working hard to appeal to the scientific community, which has long felt stifled by Steven Harper and the Conservatives.

For years, Europe’s refugee crisis has been perceived by most as a distant problem for bureaucrats to solve. Not anymore: last week, news outlets circulated tragic pictures of a Syrian toddler who had drowned in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean, prompting reactions from many of the Western world’s most powerful people. One such person is the Pope, who has promised to take in two refugee families at the Vatican. He has urged all Catholic parishes and religious communities to follow his example. The refugee crisis is massive and complex, and hospitality alone will not solve it, but this is a step in the right direction.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gdp-economy-recession-1.3210790">September 3rd: Statistics Canada Confirms Recession</a>

According to a Statistics Canada report this week, there has been a decline over the past six months in Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP)—the measure of a country’s output in goods and services. This confirms that our economy is technically in a recession, a distinction that has been controversial throughout the federal election campaign. Of course, it’s not the word “recession” that matters. What matters is how our understanding of the past informs our monetary policy, and how that in turn will affect our future. As usual, the economy is hard to predict, but perhaps we can look forward to less bickering over semantics.

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-29/islamic-state-finds-gold-coins-are-a-steal-as-throwback-currency">September 2nd: Islamic State Mints Its Plunders</a>

The school bully pushes you over and steals your lunch money, as usual. But then he does something odd: he gives you a few of his favourite Bully Pebbles, and says if you want your money back, you owe him those pebbles. You squint at him. It’s as if he thinks you’ll be able to use the pebbles to buy your lunch. You know that as soon as he wants his pebbles back, he’ll just push you over again and take them. Nevertheless, he seems proud; these pebbles make him feel important. Meanwhile, the world looks on as Islamic State creates its own currency.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/mars-simulation-project-6-people-start-1-year-of-isolation-in-hawaii-dome-1.3208763">September 1st: Mars Simulation: Tight for Space</a>

On Friday a team of six scientists entered a small dome on the barren slope of a Hawaiian volcano, where they will spend the next year in a simulation of life on Mars. The purpose of the project, conducted by the University of Hawaii and funded by NASA, is to study the social and emotional challenges of living in isolated, cramped quarters for an extended period. The dome is just eleven metres across and six metres tall, and trips outside will require a spacesuit. The participants’ internet access will be limited, but expect tweets nonetheless.

<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/0826-na-assisted-death">August 27th: Canadian Medical System Unready for Euthanasia Legislation</a>

The Canadian Medical Association recently surveyed 1407 of Canada’s 65,000 MDs to gauge opinions on euthanasia, and found that 63% would refuse if a patient asked for medical aid in dying. This result foreshadows increased legal complexity in our medical system: last February the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament would have one year to draft new legislation recognizing the right of clearly consenting adults to physician-assisted death. Granting that right may be challenging if doctors refuse to participate. Equally problematic is the fact that precious few of our doctors have been trained to assist with death, willing or no. Meanwhile, Parliament’s February 6th deadline approaches – no assistance required.

<a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/2183214/nra-sues-over-seattles-adoption-of-gun-violence-tax/">August 26th: Seattle Under Fire for Gun Tax</a>

The National Rifle Association and two other gun rights groups have sued the city of Seattle over its recent implementation of a gun violence tax. The lawsuit says the tax is legally unenforceable because local laws involving the regulation of firearms must be specifically authorized by Washington State. The city council says the Supreme Court has never interpreted whether the state’s pre-emption of gun laws includes taxation, and that the tax is designed not to regulate firearms, but to support gun safety research and violence prevention programs. Who taxes who, what regulates what – it can seem a bit petty when guns fly off shelves like bullets out of barrels.

A mock theme park opened this weekend in Weston-super-Mare, England. Dismaland, a sort of anti-Disneyland, is the brainchild of elusive British artist Banksy, well known for his satirical street art. He and 60 other artists contributed to the “bemusement” park, which includes exhibits such as a pool with mobile boats full of figurine refugees, a stand offering small loans with interest rates of several thousand percent, and a sculpture of a woman being devoured by seagulls. The gloomy attendants, wearing Mickey Mouse ears and safety vests, tell visitors to “end joy” the attractions. Dismal indeed.

Google launched a specialized search tool to help users install solar panels on the roofs of their homes. Project Sunroof uses Google’s satellite database to calculate the amount of sunlight that shines on a particular residence. It then incorporates renewable energy credits and utility rebates to estimate net savings over a multi-year lease. For those who have delayed installation due to its logistical obstacles – such as upfront costs and unfamiliar contract options – this is a great boon. It won’t make the world a brighter place; instead, it will help us harness the light of a world that has been bright enough all along.

<a href="http://www.power-technology.com/news/newsresearchers-find-new-technique-to-improve-efficiency-of-low-cost-solar-cells-4647477">August 19th: Solar Cell Efficiency Improvement</a>

Researchers have developed a manufacturing technique that doubles the electricity-producing capacity of cheap solar cells. These cells comprise two types of molecules: one that captures solar energy, and one that stores it until it can be removed as usable electricity. Formerly, these two types of molecules tended to separate and congeal in blotches after being deposited on the cell’s surface, causing great intermolecular distances and great inefficiency. The innovation is a microscopic rake, about a hundredth of the diameter of a human hair, which distributes the molecules more evenly. In a world starving for renewable, clean energy, every little bit counts.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/greece-crisis-parliament-approves-draft-3rd-bailout-after-all-night-debate-1.3190773">August 18th: Greece Bailout, Take Three</a>

On Friday the Greek parliament approved a draft third bailout, worth 85 billion euros, to be loaned over the next three years. The bill passed with a comfortable majority (222 of 300 votes), but was opposed by members of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s left-wing Syriza party. They criticize Tsipras for supporting the bill’s accompanying austerity measures, which he had promised to resist when he was elected in January. Amid inklings of another election this fall, Greece now awaits the approval of the bill by the other euro-zone parliaments. With debt currently estimated at 180% of its GDP, Greece will need all the support it can get if it is to remain the European Union.

<a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/08/12/why-the-yuans-fall-matters-to-us.html">August 13th: The yuan that got away</a>

On Tuesday the People’s Bank of China cut the value of the yuan by 1.9% to better reflect its market value. This was the largest single-day drop since 1994, and it has accentuated worry among investors that the Chinese economy is slowing. Some believe that the devaluation was a strategic attempt to price Chinese goods more competitively, which could prompt a spate of competitive devaluations among other countries (sometimes called a “currency war”). Others hold that China is simply recalibrating after years of fast growth. For Canada, whose economy is also slowing, and whose second largest trade partner is – you guessed it, China – this may spell trouble.

<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-stephen-harper-confirms-start-of-11-week-federal-campaign-1.3175136">August 10th: 2015 Canada election to be among longest and most costly in history</a>

The 2015 Canadian election campaign has officially begun. The election will take place on October 19<sup>th</sup> after a 78-day campaign, the longest since 1872. The early start is controversial: a long campaign may give the Conservatives an edge because they are the best-financed party. Steven Harper justified the move by claiming that unofficial campaigning had already been underway for some time, and that taxpayers’ money must be protected by the law. In any case, the election will be costly to Canadians. Ironically, much of it will be spent arguing about how to rescue our failing economy. Perhaps lawful campaigning could be more cheaply ensured if campaign laws were actually enforced?
