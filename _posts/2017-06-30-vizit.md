Hundreds of thousands of students worldwide are enrolled in UBCâ€™s many massive open online courses (MOOCs). These MOOCs generate huge amounts of data, much of which could be used to help instructors understand how students are engaging with their courses. 

For our capstone project in the Master of Data Science program, Matt Emery, Andrew Lim, Subi Zhang and I built a dashboard that is accessible to MOOC instructors directly in their edX course website. The dashboard is designed to help instructors to discover patterns across the structures of their courses, with a special focus on course elements where student engagement is especially high or low. The dashboard includes visualizations of how students are interacting with course content such as videos and pages, how they are performing on problem sets, and how they are behaving in the discussion forums. The code that drives the app is available as an open-source R package, and development is ongoing.

For a nice walkthrough of the main features, see [Matt's blog post](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2018-01-01-CTLT-capstone/).
