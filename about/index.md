Hi! I'm David. I used to teach writing and argumentation, and I was set on a life working with words. But as I gained experience, I realized that I could find more interesting and urgent problems by working with numbers. So, I decided to deepen my knowledge of statistics and computer science by enrolling in UBCâ€™s Master of Data Science program.

I'm especially interested in questions at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and philosophy:

- How can we know what is true?
- How can we know what is right?
- How should we set goals?
- How can we best achieve the goals we set?
