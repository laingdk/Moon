Hi! I'm David. I am a **data scientist** at the [UBC Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology](http://ctlt.ubc.ca/) and recent graduate from UBC's [Master of Data Science program](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/). I recently completed my capstone project with three of my classmates: [edXviz: an open-source R package for visualizing student engagement with edX MOOCs](https://github.com/AndrewLim1990/mooc_capstone_public).

I have worked as a **research assistant** in McMaster University's [Physics Department](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/), a **teaching assistant** in the McMaster [Arts & Science Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/), a **technical writing instructor** at [Niagara College](http://www.niagaracollege.ca/), and a **business ethics intern** at [Ethical Systems](http://ethicalsystems.org/). I have an **Honours B.Arts Sc.** from McMaster University. I code in **Python** and **R**.

I like reading, music, podcasts, swimming, windsurfing, and squash (the sport, not the vegetable).
