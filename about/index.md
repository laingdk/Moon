I'm a Canadian graduate student in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. I live at Green College, the interdisciplinary graduate residence.

I have an ongoing project to understand the fundamental principles of many academic fields. In my undergraduate years, I focused mainly on physics, philosophy, and English literature. During the two years after I graduated, I spent much of my time learning about cognitive science. Currently, I'm studying statistics and computer science, and I'm picking up some economics on the side.
