Hi! I'm David. I am a data scientist at the [UBC Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology](http://ctlt.ubc.ca/). I'm also a lecturer in the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at UBC.

I have worked as a research assistant in McMaster University's [Physics Department](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/), a teaching assistant in the McMaster [Arts & Science Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/), a technical writing instructor at [Niagara College](http://www.niagaracollege.ca/), and a business ethics intern at [Ethical Systems](http://ethicalsystems.org/).

I have a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia, and an Honours Bachelor of Arts & Science from McMaster University.

I code in Python and R.

I like reading, music, podcasts, swimming, windsurfing, and squash (the sport, not the vegetable).
