Hi! I'm David. I used to teach writing and argumentation at Niagara College, and I was set on a life working with words. But over time, I became convinced that I could find more interesting challenges, and solve more urgent problems, by working with numbers. So, in September 2016 I enrolled in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

I'm especially interested in questions at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and philosophy:

- How can we know what is true?
- How can we know what is right?
- How should we set goals?
- How can we best achieve the goals we set?
