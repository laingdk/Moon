I'm a data scientist and teacher, with a special interest in the intersection of statistics and language. I think that effective data analysis is as much about statistical methodology as it is about connecting the right numbers to the right words.

After graduating from the first cohort of UBC's [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) in the summer of 2017, I went on to [redesign and teach a course](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-11-10-DSCI-542-communication/) in the program, DSCI 542 Communication and Argumentation, which prepares students for the challenges of communicating as a data scientist. During that year I also worked as a data scientist on UBC's Learning Analytics project at the [Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology](https://ctlt.ubc.ca/): I carried out exploratory projects to inform the university's long-term plan for using data to improve teaching and learning. Now I'm working as a data scientist at [Imbellus](https://www.imbellus.com/#/), a startup that is building a novel assessment of problem-solving ability.

I program mainly in Python and R. I prefer Python for machine learning, and I prefer R for wrangling and visualization.
