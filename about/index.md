I'm a Canadian graduate student in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. I live at Green College, the interdisciplinary graduate residence.

I have an ongoing project to understand the fundamental principles of many academic fields. In my undergraduate years, I focused mainly on physics, philosophy, and English literature. During the two years after I graduated, I spent much of my time learning about cognitive science. Currently, I'm studying statistics and computer science, and I'm picking up some economics on the side.

I've worked as physics research assistant, a philosophy teaching assistant, a writer, a communications instructor, and a business ethics intern. Once I graduate, I'll be looking for work as a junior member of a data science or research team.
