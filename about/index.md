I'm a Canadian data scientist in training. I'm passionate about almost everything, but especially questions at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and philosophy:

- How can we know what is true?
- How can we know what is right?
- How should we set goals?
- How can we best achieve the goals we set?

From 2010 to 2014, I studied in the interdisciplinary Arts & Science program at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario. At various times during my degree, I was as a physics research assistant, a philosophy teaching assistant, and a member of the varsity swim team. I also volunteered at the physics help centre and the writing help centre.

After I graduated, I stayed on at McMaster as an academic skills program assistant in the Student Success Centre. I then went on a long backpacking trip in Europe, and read voraciously about cognitive science, rationality, and ethics. From September 2015 to April 2016, I worked as a writer for a Canadian news startup and as a communications lecturer at Niagara College, in Welland, Ontario.

In September 2016, I enrolled in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. Once I graduate, I'll be looking for work as a junior member of a data science or research team.
