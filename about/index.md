Hi! I'm David. I am an aspiring **data scientist**. I'm currently working on my capstone project with three of my classmates. We're building an instructor-facing dashboard for data collected by [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/ubcx) in UBC's massive open online courses (MOOCs). I'm also looking for full-time employment as a **data scientist**, starting mid-July.

I have worked as a **research assistant** in McMaster University's [Physics Department](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/), a **teaching assistant** in the McMaster [Arts & Science Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/), a **technical writing instructor** at [Niagara College](http://www.niagaracollege.ca/), and a **business ethics intern** at [Ethical Systems](http://ethicalsystems.org/). I have an **Honours B.Arts Sc.** from McMaster University. I code in **Python** and **R**.

I like reading, music, podcasts, swimming, windsurfing, and squash (the sport, not the vegetable).
